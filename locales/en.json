      "manifesto": "Here at elfDAO, we are elves - the workers, builders, and contributors of holiday cheer. We elves see the activity of gift-giving as one of the best ways to use our platform to share cheer to children. And <strong>we're sick of seeing \"Santa\" never show up for children less fortunate.</strong>",
      "why": "That's why we've created elfDAO - to fund, organize, and donate gifts to institutions, orphanages, and low-income neighborhood centers <strong>bring holiday joy to as many children as possible.</strong>"

    "manyKids": "For many kids around the globe, Christmas marks one of the most special days of the year. As we gear up for the holiday season, we plan meaningful moments around gifting our loved ones. However, let's remember that <strong>there are many kids that don't get to celebrate Christmas like we do.</strong>",
    "remember": "We must take the time to remember that there are those less fortunate, and in a world where we can utilize awesome tools like DAO to fund community projects, it's a no-brainer for us to help children have a happy Christmas.",
    "joinElfDao": "So come one, come all. Join us on our adventure to work, build, and contribute to the greatest effort to spread holiday cheer in the world. Join elfDAO.",
    "whatSuccess": "What does success look like?",
    "oneIn10": "One in ten families can‚Äôt afford to buy gifts this year because of financial strain made worse by the pandemic. There are 74 million kids under 18 in the US. That‚Äôs 7.4 million kids missing out on the joys of Christmas in the US alone!",
    "weCare": "We care about those kids. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre aiming for a big but worthwhile goal.",
    "goal": "We want to raise <strong>$1,000,000 USD</strong> by Christmas. At $25 USD per gift, our goal is to give 40,000 kids a gift this holiday season.",
    "howRaising": "How are we raising funds?",
    "raisingJuicebox": "Two ways: through collecting donations by exchanging governance tokens on <link>Juicebox</link> and selling elfDAO NFTs. Having two avenues gives you a lot of flexibility for how you want to support us.",
    "theAntaToken": "The $ANTA Token",
    "aboutAnta": "On <link>Juicebox</link>, contributors can donate any amount of ETH in return for $ANTA governance tokens. The amount of tokens you‚Äôll receive is proportional to your donation size, at a 1,000,000 $ANTA/ETH ratio. Governance tokens give you voting power within elfDAO, meaning that you‚Äôll help decide how our funds are spent. The tokens‚Äô sole purpose is for governance and voting rights for elfDAO‚Äôs use of funds.",

    "shortAnswer": "<strong>The short answer</strong>: The DAO will have the ability to choose how and where we spend the funds. The core team has ideas listed below, but remember, we're all elves here, and we want to hear from you.",
    "longAnswer": "<strong>The long answer</strong>: Depending on the size of the funds raised, we could go two ways.",
    "longAnswerOption1": "If our fund size is smaller than 10,000 presents (10k * $25 = $250,000), the core team will present a handful of reputable charitable organizations for DAO members to vote on.",
    "longAnswerOption2": "If our fund size is larger than 10,000 presents ($250,000) giving us the ability to distribute funds across many recipients, we will open for proposals from charitable organizations. Community members will be encouraged to nominate organizations and nudge them to submit proposals. DAO members will then vote on the proposals and help us determine distribution.",
    "community": "As a community-run initiative, we‚Äôre decentralizing decision-making about our donation recipients. That‚Äôs what makes us unique compared to other Christmas gift-giving charities.",
    "targetGoal": "If we reach our funding target of $1 million, we hope elfDAO‚Äôs members will push small, local organizations to submit funding proposals. These organizations could include community centers, orphanages, churches, or other groups who are registered as 501c3 in good standing with the IRS (U.S. Internal Revenue Service).",

    "whatLegal": "What does the legal structure look like?",
    "whatLegalResponse": "We‚Äôve partnered with <link>Endaoment</link>, a 501(c)(3) U.S. PBC that specializes in facilitating the donation of digital assets to charities. They‚Äôve committed to making sure that every bit of ETH we raise can be distributed to the charities we vote on; whether they take crypto or USD.",
    "ownLegal": "Do you have your own legal entity?",
    "ownLegalResponse": "No. The DAO does not plan to own any fiat or physical assets, so there is no need for our own entity. Conversion from digital assets to fiat for the purposes of charitable donations will be handled by our partner, <link>Endaoment</link>."
