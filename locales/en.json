And <strong>we're sick of seeing \"Santa\" never show up for children less fortunate.</strong>",

    "whereFunds": "Where will the Funds go?",

    "reservedAmount": "In addition, we will be reserving 2.5% of funds raised to cover overhead costs (1% for multi-signature wallet and Juicebox gas fees, 1.5% for enDAOment, our fiscal sponsorâ€™s transaction fees) as managed by the core team. All overhead costs will be transparently documented and none will be used to compensate the core team â€” leftover operational funds will be contributed to charity.",
    "codified": "All of this information will be codified in the initial governance proposal that the DAO puts forth on January 2nd, 2022. $GIFT token holders will be able to vote and propose changes to our proposal.",

    "whyNotCrowdfund": "Why aren't you just using a crowdfund website?",
    "whyNotCrowdfundResponse": "Crowdfund websites take fees off every single donation transaction. We want every dollar of donations to go towards purchasing gifts for kids. Our overhead costs to deploy the smart contracts and transfer the ETH to USD will be significantly less than the amount a crowdfund site would take. In addition, DAO governance mechanisms allow the donor community as a whole to decide where funds raised are going.",
